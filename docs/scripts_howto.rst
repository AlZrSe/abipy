Post-processing How-To

This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about the usage of the AbiPy scripts. 
Feel free to suggest new entries!

.. contents::
   :backlinks: top

.. important::

    The scripts employ the file extension to detect the file type so don't change it.

    Remember that it is possible to get the documentation of the 
    script by just adding ``--help`` after the scripts name.

    For example::

        abistruct.py --help
        
    gives the documentation and usage examples for the ``abistruct.py`` script while::

        abistruct.py COMMAND --help
    
    prints the documentation for ``COMMAND`` and the options supported by ``COMMAND``.


Get information about a generic ``FILE``
----------------------------------------

Use::

    abiopen.py FILE -p 

to print information about a file inside the terminal.

Use ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` to increase verbosity level. 
The option can be can be supplied multiple times e.g. ``-vv``.

Get all file extensions supported by ``abiopen.py``
---------------------------------------------------

Use::

    abiopen.py --help

.. command-output:: abiopen.py --help


Convert the structure stored in ``FILE`` to a different format 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Use::

    abistruct.py convert FILE

to read the structure from ``FILE`` and generate a CIF_ file (default behaviour).

The majority of the netcdf_ files produced by Abinit contain structural information
so this command can be used with netcdf ouput files as well as Abinit input/output 
files and all the other formats supported by pymatgen e.g. POSCAR files.
Other formats can be specified with the ``-f`` option.
For example::

    abistruct.py convert FILE -f abivars

gives the Abinit input variables while::

    abistruct.py convert FILE -f xsf > out.xsf

exports the structure to the ``xsf`` format (xcrysden_) and save it to file.

Use::

    abistruct.py convert --help

to list the formats supported.

Check if my Abinit input file is OK
-----------------------------------

First of all, one can use::

    abiopen.py ../abipy/data/refs/si_ebands/run.abi -p

to print the crystalline structure and find the space group with the spglib_ library.

If the structure looks good, use the :ref:`abinp.py` script with the ``validate`` command as in::

    abinp.py validate run.abi       
    
to validate the input file with Abinit (requires ``manager.yml`` and, obviously, Abinit).

The script provides other options to invoke Abinit 
to get space group information, the list of k-points in the IBZ.
the list of atomic perturbations for phonons or the list of autoparal configurations.
See ``abinp.py --help`` for futher info.

Get a quick look to a file
--------------------------

The :ref:`abiview.py` script is especially designed for this task.
The syntax is ``abistruct.py COMMAND FILE`` where ``COMMAND`` is either 
the Abinit file extension or the AbiPy object we want to visualize.

To get a quick look at the DDB file, use::

    abiview.py ddb out_DDB

This command invokes anaddb to compute phonon bands and DOS from the DDB and produces matplotlib_ plots.

If ``FILE`` contains electronic band energies, use e.g.::

    abiview.py ebands out_GSR.nc

to plot the KS eigenvalues (the same command works for other files such as ``WFK.nc``, ``DEN.nc`` etcetera. 

Note that :ref:`abiview.py` uses a predefined logic to visualize the data.
There are options to tune some parameters and/or export data in different formats
but exposing the AbiPy API from the command line is not easy.

For a more flexible interface, we suggest to use::

    abiopen.py FILE

to start an ipython_ shell that will allow you to interact with the python object directly.

If you have installed jupyter_ on your machine/cluster and you have a web browser, use::

    abiopen.py FILE -nb

to generate automatically a predefined jupyter notebook associated to the file type.

Visualize a structure
---------------------

The visualization of the structure is delegated to external graphical applications
that must be istalled on your machine. 
AbiPy will extract the structure from ``FILE``, convert it to one of the formats 
supported by the graphical application and finally invoke the executable.
If you have vesta_ installed in one of the standard 
locations of your machine, you can simply execute::

    abistruct.py visualize FILE

inside the terminal. 
Other applications can be specified with the ``--application`` option.
At present, AbiPy supports vesta_, ovito_, xcrysden_, avogadro_, and v_sim_.

To visualize the crystalline structure inside the jupyter_ notebook, you may want to
try the nbjsmol_ jupyter extension.

Get neighbors for each atom in the unit cell out to a distance radius
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If we are interested in the environment/nearest neighbours of the atoms in the unit cell
we can analyze the different coordinations with::

    abistruct.py neighbors sic_relax_HIST.nc

.. code-block:: shell

    Finding neighbors for each atom in the unit cell, out to a distance 2 [Angstrom]

    [0] site PeriodicSite: C (0.0000, -0.0000, 0.0000) [-0.0000, 0.0000, -0.0000] has 4 neighbors:

Search on the Materials Project database for structures
-------------------------------------------------------

Use::

    abistruct.py mp_search LiF

to search on the `materials project`_ database for structures corresponding to a 
chemical system or formula e.g. ``Fe2O3`` or ``Li-Fe-O`` or
``Ir-O-*`` for wildcard pattern matching.

The script prints the results to terminal in tabular form:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Found 2 structures in materials project database (use `verbose` to get full info)
               pretty_formula  e_above_hull  energy_per_atom  \
    mp-1138               LiF      0.000000        -4.845142
    mp-1009009            LiF      0.273111        -4.572031

    mp-1009009                  -2.907328       2  16.768040             Pm-3m

                spacegroup.number  band_gap  total_magnetization material_id
    mp-1138                   225    8.7161                  0.0     mp-1138
    mp-1009009                221    7.5046                 -0.0  mp-1009009


.. important::

    The script will try to connect to the materials project server.
    You need a ``~/.pmgrc.yaml`` configuration file inside your home directory
    with the authentication token **PMG_MAPI_KEY**.
    For further info please refer to the 
    `pymatgen documentation <http://pymatgen.org/usage.html#pymatgen-matproj-rest-integration-with-the-materials-project-rest-api>`_

The script provides other commands to get (experimental) structures from the COD_ database,
find matching structures on the `materials project`_ website and generate phase diagrams.
See ``abistruct.py --help`` for more examples.

Compare my structure with the Materials Project database
--------------------------------------------------------

Let's assume we have performed a structural relaxation and we want
to compare our results with the Materials Project data.
One can use the :ref:`abicomp.py` structure to extract the structure from the HIST.nc_
file and compare the data with the database::

    abicomp.py mp_structure ../abipy/data/refs/sic_relax_HIST.nc

It's also possible to select only the structures with the same space group number as the input structure with::

    abicomp.py mp_structure ../abipy/data/refs/sic_relax_HIST.nc --same-spgnum

that produces

.. code-block:: ipython

    Lattice parameters:
            formula  natom  angle0  angle1  angle2         a         b         c  \
    mp-8062  Si1 C1      2    60.0    60.0    60.0  3.096817  3.096817  3.096817
    this     Si1 C1      2    60.0    60.0    60.0  3.064763  3.064763  3.064763

                volume abispg_num spglib_symb  spglib_num
    mp-8062  21.000596       None       F-43m         216
    this     20.355222       None       F-43m         216

    Use --verbose to print atomic positions.

Note that one can replace the HIST.nc_ file with any other file providing a structure object.

.. important::

    The structures of the materials project have been obtained with the GGA-PBE functional
    and they might include the U term in the Hamiltonian.
    One should take into account these different settings when comparing structural relaxations.


Visualize the iterations of the SCF cycle
-----------------------------------------

Use::

    abiview.py abo run.abo

to plot the SCF iterations or the steps of the structural relaxations or the DFPT SCF cycles
(depending on the content of run.abo)

Note that one can also use::
    
    abiview.py log run.log

to print the warnings/comments/errors reported in the Abinit log file ``run.log``.

Export bands to xmgrace format 
------------------------------

But |ElectronBands| and |PhononBands| provide a ``to_xmgrace`` method to produce xmgrace_ files.
To export the data to xmgrace, use :ref:`abiview.py` with the ``--xmgrace`` option.
For electrons, use::

    abiview.py ebands out_GSR.nc --xmgrace

and::

    abiview.py phbands out_PHBST.nc -xmgrace 

for phonons.

Plot the Fermi surface
----------------------

Use::

    abiview.py ebands out_GSR.nc --bxsf

to export a set of band energies in BXSF format
suitable for the visualization of the Fermi surface with xcrysden_.
Then use::

    xcrysden --bxsf BXSF_FILE

to visualize the Fermi surface with xcrysden_

.. code-block:: ipython

    abifile.ebands.to_bxsf("mgb2.bxsf")    

.. important::

    This option requires k-points in the irreducible wedge and a gamma-centered k-mesh.

Visualize phonon displacements
------------------------------

AbiPy is interfaced with the phononwebsite_ project 
If you have already installed the python package from `github <https://github.com/henriquemiranda/phononwebsite>`_
it's possbile to export the ``PHBST.nc`` to JSON and then load the file via the web-interface.
Alternatively, it's possible to automate the entire procedure with the :ref:`abiview.py` script.

Use::

    abiview.py phbands out_PHBST.nc -web

to start a local webserver and open the HTML page inside the default browser 
(the browser can be changed with the ``--browser`` option).

It is also possible to visualize the phonon modes starting directly from a DDB_ file with::

    abiview.py ddb -web

In this case, AbiPy will invoke anaddb to produce the ``PHBST.nc`` file on an automatically 
generated q-path and then start the webserver.

Visualize the results of a structural relaxation
------------------------------------------------

The quickest way is to use::

    abiview hist out_HIST.nc

to plot the results with matplotlib or:: 

    abiopen.py out_HIST.nc -p
    
to print the most important results to terminal.

Note that it's possible to generate a ``XDATCAR`` file with::

    abiview hist out_HIST.nc --xdatcar

and visualize the crystalline structure with ovito_::

    abiview hist out_HIST.nc -appname=ovito

.. important::

    The XDATCAR format assumes a fixed unit cell so you won't be able
    to visualize the modifications of the unit cell lattice vectors in ovito.

Compare multiple files
----------------------

The :ref:`abicomp.py` script is explicitely designed for this kind of task.
It operates on multiple files (usually files with the same extension) and 
either produces matplotlib_ plots or creates AbiPy robots providing methods
to analyze the results, perform convergence studies and build pandas DataFrames_.

The ``COMMAND`` defines the quantity to be compared, followed by a list of filenames.

To compare e.g. the structure given in one Abinit input file with the structure
coming from a GSR.nc_ file, use::

    abicomp.py structure run.abi out_GSR.nc

.. note::

    In this example, we can use files of different type because they
    both have a Structure object. This philosophy can be applied to other commands as well:
    everything works as long as AbiPy is able to extract the quantity of interest from the file.

To plot multiple electronic structures on a grid, use::

    abicomp.py ebands *_GSR.nc out2_WFK.nc -p

Remember that it is possible to use the shell syntax ``*_GSR.nc`` to select all files with a given extension.
If you have nested directories, use unix ``find`` to scan the directory tree for files matching a given pattern
For example::

    abicomp.py ebands `find . -name *_GSR.nc` 

finds all ``GSR.nc`` files contained withing the current working directory.
The output of ``find`` is then passed to :ref:`abicomp.py`.

.. note::

    Note the `backticks syntax <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27428/what-does-backquote-backtick-mean-in-commands>`_
    used in the command.

to build a ``plotter`` object and open the ipython_ terminal.
Then, inside ipython, type

.. code-block:: ipython

    df = plotter.get_ebands_dataframe()
    %matplotlib
    df.plot("")

to build a pandas DataFrame_ and plot ...

Let's take the case of Gd2SiO5 (GSO).  
I had to do some extra calculations and so I wanted to get the input structure somewhere. 
In our case, there was an abinit input file in your $HOME (leds/GSO/bulk/band/band.in).
You can get the structure and the related abinit variables even from that file 
(any file containing structural infos can be used. For a list of (all) the supported files, issue "abiopen.py --help”)

If we compare this structure with those we used in the case of LSO and YSO, we can see that 
it's not the same structure: we take advantage of pymatgen StructureMatcher and the "anonymous" 
matching i.e. even structures which have different elements can be matched::

    abicomp.py structure GSO/bulk/band.in YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc --group --anonymous

.. code-block:: bash

    Grouping 2 structures by element
    Group 0: 
            - GSO/bulk/band.in (Gd8 Si4 O20), vol: 419.61 A^3, P2_1/c (14)

    Group 1: 
            - YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc (Y8 Si4 O20), vol: 439.11 A^3, C2/c (15)

while::

    abicomp.py structure GSO/bulk/band.in YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc LSO/lsoo_GSR.nc --group --anonymous

.. code-block:: bash

    Grouping 3 structures by element
    Group 0: 
            - GSO/bulk/band.in (Gd8 Si4 O20), vol: 419.61 A^3, P2_1/c (14)

    Group 1: 
            - YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc (Y8 Si4 O20), vol: 439.11 A^3, C2/c (15)
            - LSO/lsoo_GSR.nc (Lu8 Si4 O20), vol: 415.71 A^3, C2/c (15)

Indeed, if you look for YSO on the Materials Project database, you find two phases: mp-3520  and mp-554420, 
both with 32 atoms per cell but different space group::

    abistruct.py mp_search Y2SiO5

.. code-block:: bash

    # Found 2 structures in materials project database (use `verbose` to get full info)
              pretty_formula  e_above_hull  energy_per_atom  \
    mp-3520           Y2SiO5      0.000000        -8.749458   
    mp-554420         Y2SiO5      0.025002        -8.724456   

               formation_energy_per_atom  nsites      volume spacegroup.symbol  \
    mp-3520                    -3.808455      32  444.282737              C2/c   
    mp-554420                  -3.783453      32  411.813392            P2_1/c   

               spacegroup.number  band_gap  total_magnetization material_id  
    mp-3520                   15    4.8947                  0.0     mp-3520  
    mp-554420                 14    4.7342                  0.0   mp-554420  

The former is the stable one, the latter has an energy above the hull of 0.025 eV/atom. 
(In the case of GSO, “abistruct.py mp_search Gd2SiO5” will give only one structure (mp-542831) with P2_1/c symmetry)

You could, for example, download them as cif::

    abistruct.py pmgdata mp-554420 -f cif > mp-554420.cif

and then see if the structure are similar to the one than we obtained a while ago::

    abicomp.py structure GSO/bulk/band.in LSO/lsoo_GSR.nc YSO/* --group --anonymous

.. code-block:: bash

    Grouping 5 structures by element
    Group 0: 
            - GSO/bulk/band.in (Gd8 Si4 O20), vol: 419.61 A^3, P2_1/c (14)
            - YSO/mp-554420.cif (Y8 Si4 O20), vol: 411.81 A^3, P2_1/c (14)

    Group 1: 
            - LSO/lsoo_GSR.nc (Lu8 Si4 O20), vol: 415.71 A^3, C2/c (15)
            - YSO/mp-3520.cif (Y8 Si4 O20), vol: 444.28 A^3, C2/c (15)
            - YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc (Y8 Si4 O20), vol: 439.11 A^3, C2/c (15) 

You might also want to compare the structures you obtained with those of the Materials Project::

    abicomp.py structure YSO/*cif YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc

.. code-block:: bash

    Lattice parameters:
                          formula  natom     angle0      angle1      angle2  \
    YSO/mp-3520.cif    Y8 Si4 O20     32  72.253470   69.403142   64.857542   
    YSO/mp-554420.cif  Y8 Si4 O20     32  90.000000  106.377942   90.000000   
    YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc    Y8 Si4 O20     32  61.231899  118.768101  129.711417   

                              a         b          c      volume abispg_num  \
    YSO/mp-3520.cif    6.831769  8.039827   9.710002  444.282737       None   
    YSO/mp-554420.cif  6.749247  6.955070   9.143946  411.813392       None   
    YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc    8.008236  8.008236  10.508789  439.110049         15   

                      spglib_symb  spglib_num  
    YSO/mp-3520.cif          C2/c          15  
    YSO/mp-554420.cif      P2_1/c          14  
    YSO/ysoo_GSR.nc          C2/c          15 

Anyway, we're interested in the environment/nearest neighbours of the oxygen atoms. 
We can easily identify the different coordination with::

    abistruct.py neighbors YSO/mp-3520.cif -r 2.7
 
Finding neighbors for each atom in the unit cell, out to a distance 2.7 [Angstrom]

You'll see that we can identify the Y lying at sites coordinated with 6 oxygens and those at sites with 7 oxygens. 
 
Finally, if you want to compare total energies of the two GSO phases::

    abicomp.py getattr energy GSO/C2c/bulk/gsoo_GSR.nc GSO/P2_1c/bulk/gsoo_GSR.nc

.. code-block:: bash

    -17432.3600217 eV    # File:  GSO/C2c/bulk/gsoo_GSR.nc
    -17431.8874098 eV    # File:  GSO/P2_1c/bulk/gsoo_GSR.nc

and optionally use ``--plot`` to plot the data.

So the C2c phase is the most stable for GSO too.
(In case one does not know which are the "attributes" you can extract from the files with::

    abicomp.py getattr GSO/C2c/bulk/gsoo_GSR.nc GSO/P2_1c/bulk/gsoo_GSR.nc --list

Profile the scripts
-------------------

All AbiPy script can be executed in profile mode by just prepending the ``prof`` keyword  
to the command line arguments. 
This option could be useful if the script seems to be slow and you need to understand what's happening.

Use::

    abiopen.py prof FILE

or::

    abistruct.py prof COMMAND FILE

if the script requires a ``COMMAND`` argument.

Get the description of a variable 
---------------------------------

The :ref:`abidoc.py` script provides a simplified interface to the Abinit documentation.

Use::

    abidoc.py man ecut
