=============
Getting AbiPy
=============

--------------
Stable version
--------------

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable release
that can be installed with::

    $ pip install abipy

Note that you may need to install pymatgen and other critical dependencies manually.
In this case, please consult the detailed installation instructions provided by the
`pymatgen howto <http://pymatgen.org/index.html#standard-install>`_ to install pymatgen 
and then follow the instructions in the :ref:`netcdf4_installation` section.

Note, however, that the installation process is greatly simplified if you install the required 
python packages through one of the following python distributions:

  * `Anaconda <https://continuum.io/downloads>`_

  * `Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy>`_

We routinely use ``conda`` to test new developments with multiple versions of Python and multiple virtual environments.
The anaconda distribution already provides the most critical dependencies (``matplotlib``, ``scipy`` ...)
in the form of pre-compiled packages and ``netcdf4`` can be easily installed with::

    conda install netcdf4

Additional information on the steps required to install AbiPy with anaconda 
are available in the :ref:`anaconda_howto` howto as well as in the 
`conda-based-install <http://pymatgen.org/installation.html#conda-based-install>`_
section of the pymatgen documentation.

We are also working with the `Spack <https://github.com/LLNL/spack>`_ community
to provide packages for AbiPy and Abinit in order to facilitate the installation on large supercomputing centers.

Advanced users who need to compile a local version of the python interpreter and install the AbiPy dependencies
manually can consult the :ref:`howto_compile_python_and_bootstrap_pip` document.

---------------------
Optional dependencies
---------------------

Optional libraries that are required if you need certain features:

``ipython``

    Required to interact with the AbiPy/Pymatgen objects in the ipython shell
    (strongly recommended, already provided by conda).

``jupyter`` and ``nbformat``

    Required to generate jupyter notebooks.
    Install these two packages with ``conda install jupyter nbformat`` or use ``pip``.
    Recommended but you will also need a web browser to open the notebook.

``seaborn``

    Python visualization library based on matplotlib. 
    It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
    Used in AbiPy for particular plots.

``wxPython`` and ``wxmplot`` for the GUI

    Use ``conda install wxpython``
    The directory ``abipy.gui.demos`` contains demos that can be used to test the installation.
    of the GUI (run the script ``runall.py`` to have an overview of the different graphical interfaces).

.. _anaconda_howto:

--------------
Anaconda Howto
--------------

Download the anaconda installer from the `official web-site <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.
Choose the version that matches your OS and select python2.7.
You may want to use the ``wget`` utility to download the anaconda script directly from the terminal
(useful if you are installing anaconda on a cluster).

Run the bash script in the terminal and follow the instructions.
By default, the installer creates the ``anaconda`` directory in your home.
Once the installation is completed, execute::

    $ source ~/anaconda/bin/activate root

to activate the ``root`` environment.
The output of ``which python`` should show that you are using the python interpreter provided by anaconda.

Use the ``conda`` command-line interface to install the packages not included in the official distribution.
For example, you can install ``pyyaml`` and ``netcdf4`` with::

    $ conda install pyyaml netcdf4

Remember that if a package is not available in the official conda repository, you can always
use ``pip install`` or download the package from one of the conda channels.
For example, if you encounter problems while installing the spacegroup library
with ``pip install pyspglib``, you can install the pre-compiled library from the ``jochym`` channel with::

    $ conda install -c jochym pyspglib

Now you can install the stable version of ``abipy`` with::

    $ pip install abipy

If you want to use the developmental version, clone (or fork) the repositories on github
(see also the :ref:`developmental_version` section).

Once you have completed the installation of AbiPy and pymatgen, open the ``ipython`` shell and type::

    from abipy import abilab

to check the installation.

Optionally, you may want to execute::

    $ conda install wxpython

to install the ``wxpython`` graphical toolkit required for the GUIs.

Note that one can use ``conda`` to create different environments with different
versions of the python interpreter or different libraries.
Further information are available on the `official website <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html>`_.


.. _developmental_version:

---------------------
Developmental version
---------------------

Getting the developmental version of AbiPy is easy. You can clone it from the 
`github repository <https://github.com/abinit/abipy>`_ using this command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/abinit/abipy

After cloning the repository, type::

    $ python setup.py install

or alternately::

    $ python setup.py develop

to install the package in developmental mode 
(this is the recommended approach, especially if you are planning to implement new features).

The Github version include test files for complete unit testing.
To run the suite of unit tests, make sure you have ``py.test`` (recommended) 
or ``nose`` installed and then just type::

    $ py.test

or::

    $ nosetests

in the AbiPy root directory.
Unit tests require two additional packages that can be installed with::

   $ pip install nose-exclude scripttest

Contributing to AbiPy is relatively easy.
Just send us a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_.
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the repository
AbiPy uses the `Git Flow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_ branching model.
The ``develop`` branch contains the latest contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points
to the latest stable release.


.. _howto_compile_python_and_bootstrap_pip:

-------------------------------------
How to compile the Python interpreter
-------------------------------------

This section discusses how to install a local version of the python interpreter as well
as the most important dependencies needed by AbiPy.
This approach may be needed if you want to use AbiPy on a machine (e.g. a cluster)
in which you don't have root privileges and the version of the python interpreter is too old 
or if for some reasons you prefer not to use ``anaconda``.
In this case you cannot use a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ 
on top of the preexisting python library.

First of all, you have to create a new directory containing your python interpreter
as well as as the libraries and the other executables needed by AbiPy.
Let's assume we decided to create this directory inside ``$HOME`` and let's call it ``local``::

    $ mkdir $HOME/local

Now change your ``~/.bashrc`` file and add the following three lines::

    export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/include/:$C_INCLUDE_PATH

so that other scripts and tools will know where to find the new binaries/libraries/include files they need.

Get the python tarball from the `official site <https://www.python.org>`_ and unpack it.
Configure the package with the ``--prefix`` option and compile the code
(use the ``-j`` option to speedup the compilation with threads)::

    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
    $ make -j4

At the end, you should get the list of modules that could not be built because 
your system does not provide the required libraries.
The installation should be OK for AbiPy if you get::

    Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
    _sqlite3           bsddb185           dl              
    imageop            sunaudiodev                        
    To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

If, on the other hand, python has been built without ``bz2`` or ``_tkinter`` you are in trouble 
because these packages are required.

``bz2`` is more fundamental than ``_tkinter`` because it is used to compress/uncompress files.
AbiPy/Pymatgen won't work without ``bz2`` and you have to install the ``bzip`` library with the C headers.
The source code is available from `bzip.org <www.bzip.org>`_
See also `this post <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12806122/missing-python-bz2-module>`_ on stackoverflow.

``Tkinter`` is less important than ``bz2`` but without it you won't be able to use the ``matplotlib`` graphical back-end.
If you want ``matplotlib`` with the Tk back-end, you have to install Tk/Tcl. 
Get the tarball from the `tcl.tk site <www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/downloads.html>`_, configure 
with ``--prefix`` and ``make && make install`` as usual.
Then reconfigure python. 

Once you have solved the problem with the missing modules, you can run the tests with::

    $ make test 

and install the python interpreter with::

    $ make install

Now we have our python interpreter installed in ``$HOME/local``::

    $ which python 
    $HOME/local/bin/python

but we still need to install ``easy_install`` and ``pip`` so that we can automatically 
download and install other python packages.

To install ``easy_install``::

    $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python

    $ which easy_install
    $HOME/local/bin/easy_install

For more info, consult the `setuptools page <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_

Now use ``easy_install`` to install ``pip``::

    $ easy_install pip

    # Upgrade setuptools with
    $ pip install setuptools --upgrade

Henceforth we can start to use ``pip`` to install the python modules.
Start with ``cython`` and ``numpy``::

    $ pip install cython 
    $ pip install numpy

The installation of ``scipy`` is more complicated due to the need for the BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
Try first::

    $ pip install scipy

If the installer does not find ``BLAS/LAPACK`` in your system, consult the
`scipy documentation <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/linux.html#id1>`_.

.. _netcdf4_installation:

---------------------------------------------------
How to install HDF5/Netcdf4 and the python bindings
---------------------------------------------------

Obtain the latest ``HDF5`` software from the `official web-site <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html>`_.
Configure the package with ``--enable-hl --enable-shared`` and the ``--prefix`` option as usual.
Build and install with::

    make
    make install

Finally define the environment variable ``$HDF5_DIR`` with::

    export HDF5_DIR=$HOME/local

Get the latest stable netCDF-C release from `this page <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp>`_.
Configure with::

    configure --prefix=$HOME/local --enable-netcdf-4 --enable-shared \
      CPPFLAGS="-I$HDF5_DIR/include" LDFLAGS="-L$HDF5_DIR/lib"

Build and install with ``make && make install``
Define the environment variable ``$NETCDF4_DIR``::

    export NETCDF4_DIR=$HOME/local

Now we can download and install the python interface with::

    pip install netcdf4

You may want to consult the official `netcdf4-python documentation <http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python>`_.

---------------
Troubleshooting
---------------

If python stops with the error message::

    "ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8"

add the following line to your ``.bashrc`` file inside your ``$HOME`` (``.profile`` if MacOSx)::

    export LC_ALL=C

reload the environment with ``source ~/.bashrc`` and rerun the code.
