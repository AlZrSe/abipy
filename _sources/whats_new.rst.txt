abipy-0.2
=========

Mar 10 2017

This is the first stable release in which we have reached a relatively stable API
and a well-defined interface with the netcdf files produced by Abinit.
We recommend Abinit >= 8.0.8b, version 8.2.2 is required to analyze the electronic fatbands
saved in the ``FATBANDS.nc`` file.
