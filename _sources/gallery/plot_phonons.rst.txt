.. code-block:: python

    from abipy.abilab import abiopen
    import abipy.data as abidata

    # Open PHBST file produced by anaddb and extract the phonon bands object.
    # (alternatively one can use the shell and `abiopen.py OUT_PHBST.nc -nb` 
    # to open the file in a jupyter notebook.
    with abiopen(abidata.ref_file("trf2_5.out_PHBST.nc")) as ncfile:
        phbands = ncfile.phbands

    # Plot the phonon frequencies. Note that the labels for the q-points
    # are found automatically in an internal database.
    phbands.plot(units="cm-1", title="AlAs without LO-TO splitting")

    # Alternatively you can use the optional argument qlabels
    # that defines the mapping reduced_coordinates --> name of the q-point.
    #qlabels = {
    #    (0,0,0): "$\Gamma$",
    #    (0.375, 0.375, 0.7500): "K",
    #    (0.5, 0.5, 1.0): "X",
    #    (0.5, 0.5, 0.5): "L",
    #    (0.5, 0.0, 0.5): "X",
    #    (0.5, 0.25, 0.75): "W",
    #}

    # and pass it to the plot method:
    #phbands.plot(title="AlAs without LO-TO splitting", qlabels=qlabels)
