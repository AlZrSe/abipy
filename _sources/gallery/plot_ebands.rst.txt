Band structure plot
===================

This example shows how to plot a band structure
using the eigenvalues stored in the GSR file 
produced at the end of the GS run.

    # Here we use one of the GSR files shipped with abipy.
    # Replace filename with the path to your GSR file or your WFK file.
    filename = abidata.ref_file("si_nscf_GSR.nc")

    # Open the GSR file and extract the band structure.
    # (alternatively one can use the shell and `abiopen.py OUT_GSR.nc -nb` 
    # to open the file in a jupyter notebook.
    with abiopen(filename) as ncfile:
        ebands = ncfile.ebands

    # Plot the band energies. Note that the labels for the k-points
    # are found automatically in an internal database.
    ebands.plot(title="Silicon band structure")

    # Plot the BZ and the k-point path.
    ebands.kpoints.plot()
