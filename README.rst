Abipy is an open-source library for analyzing the results produced by ABINIT (http://www.abinit.org), 
an open-source program for the ab-initio calculation of the physical properties of materials 
within Density Functional Theory (DFT).
Abipy is written in Python and is designed with the philosophy that you should be able to create 
simple plots with just a few commands.

Abipy is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your own contributions.  
These contributions can be in the form of additional tools or modules you develop, or even simple things 
such as bug reports. 
Please report any bugs and issues at abipy's `Github page <https://github.com/gmatteo/abipy>`_.

6. netCDF4

7. pyyaml 3.1.0+

Optional dependencies
---------------------

Optional libraries that are required if you need certain features:

The directory `abipy.gui.demos` contains demos that can be used to test the installation 
(run the script `runall.py` to have an overview of the different graphical interfaces).


Using abipy
===========

Basic usage
-----------

Here are some quick examples of the core capabilities and objects:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import abipy as ab
    >>>

The above example illustrates only the most basic capabilities of abipy.

.. note:: Examples

    A good way to explore the functionality of abipy is to look at examples.
    We have created a `Github wiki page <https://github.com/gmatteo/abipy/wiki>`_ 
    to allow users to share their Github gists (essentially mini git repos of scripts)
    performing various kinds of functions with abipy. 
    Please feel free to check them out and we welcome your contributions as well!
