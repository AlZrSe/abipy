Abipy is an open-source library for analyzing the results produced by ABINIT (http://www.abinit.org), 
an open-source program for the ab-initio calculation of the physical properties of materials within Density Functional Theory (DFT).
Abipy is written in Python and is designed with the philosophy that you should be able to create simple plots with just a few commands.

Abipy is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your own contributions.  
These contributions can be in the form of additional tools or modules you develop, or even simple things such as bug reports. 
Please report any bugs and issues at abipy's `Github page <https://github.com/gmatteo/abipy>`_.

or to install the package in developmental mode::

    python setup.py develop

Requirements
============

All required dependencies should be automatically taken care of if you
install abipy using easy_install or pip. 
Otherwise, these packages should be available on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_.

1. Python 2.7+ required. 

3. pymatgen 2.7.3+

4. numpy - For array, matrix and other numerical manipulations. 

5. matplotlib 1.1+

6. scipy 0.10+

7. netCDF4

Optional dependencies

Optional libraries that are required if you need certain features:

1. nose - For complete unittesting.

Using abipy
===========

Basic usage
-----------

Here are some quick examples of the core capabilities and objects:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import abipy as ab
    >>>

The above example illustrates only the most basic capabilities of abipy.

.. note:: Examples

    A good way to explore the functionality of abipy is to look at examples.
    We have created a `Github wiki page <https://github.com/gmatteo/abipy/wiki>`_ 
    to allow users to share their Github gists (essentially mini git repos of scripts)
    performing various kinds of functions with abipy. 
    Please feel free to check them out and we welcome your contributions as well!
