TODO LIST:

  #. Add integration test for dilatmx error handler

  # Fix issue with DOJO_REPORT and PAW XML files.

  # run_qptdm_flow does not work anymore

  # Check xsf_write_data

  # Add treatment of out-of-boundary conditions in scissors operator.

  # Remove strategies, replace them with AbiInput and a flexible API 
    with getters and setters.

  # Add possibility of specifying the max number of CPUs that can be used  
    for a flow at the level of the scheduler.

  # Fix problem with AbiniEvent format, src_file and scr_line (see src/67_common/scprqt.F90)
    Introduce an integer flag (msg_level) to be passed to msg_hndl

  # Try to generalize the (very nice) approach used by Guido to handle target_dilatmx
    WorkWithCondition(...) could be used to simulate a convergence study. The main 
    problem is how to include input_generators (__next__) while preserving data persistence
    with pickle! I've already done something related to this problem in FlowCallback...

  # ABINIT abort file should not be produced if we the exit is expected otherwise we 
    can have IO race conditions and ABI_CRITICAL events!!!!!!!
