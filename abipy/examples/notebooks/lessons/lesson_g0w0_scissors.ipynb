      "Standard functionals (LDA and GGA), systematically underestimate band gaps, giving values \n",
      "that are about 30-40% smaller than experimental data.\n",
      "The inability of standard Kohn-Sham (KS) theory to give band gaps close to experiment is often  referred to as the **band-gap problem**. \n",
      "From a theoretical point of view this is not surprising  since KS eigenvalues are not supposed to give the correct band energies.\n",
      "The band structure of a crystal is rigorously defined as the energies needed to add or subtract electrons from the many-body system\n",
      "which, in turn, are related to the difference between total energies of many-body states differing by one electron. \n",
      "An alternative, more traditional, approach to the study of exchange-correlation effects in \n",
      "many-body systems is provided by Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) which defines a rigorous approach to the description of excited-state properties, \n",
      "based on the Green's function formalism.\n",
      "In this lesson, we discuss how to use the MBPT part of ABINIT to compute the band-structure of silicon within the so-called $G_0W_0$ approximation.\n",

      "------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In this lesson, we will construct an `abipy` flow made of two works.\n",
      "The first work is a standard KS band-structure calculation that consists of \n",
      "an initial GS calculation to get the density followed by two NSCF calculations.\n",
      "The first NSCF task computes the KS eigenvalues on a high-symmetry path in the BZ,\n",
      "whereas the second NSCF task is done on a homogeneous k-mesh so that one can calculate \n",
      "the DOS from the KS eigenvalues. These two NSCF tasks \n",
      "\n",
      "The second work represents a GW workflow in which we read the density computed  in the first task of \n",
      "the previous work to obtain and compute the KS eigenvalues and eigenvectors for many empty states. \n",
      "The WFK file produced in this step is then used to compute the screened interaction $W$. \n",
      "Finally we do a self-energy calculation in which we use the $W$ produced\n",
      "in the previous step and the WFK file to compute the matrix elements of the self-energy and \n",
      "the $G_0W_0$ corrections for all the k-points in the IBZ and 8 bands (4 occupied + 4 empty)\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the flow is completed, we can post-process the results and compute the $G_0W_0$ band-structure\n",
      "of silicon with a scissors operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course of this lesson\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "This lesson can be started in ipython by importing it:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        from abipy.lessons import lesson_g0w0 as lesson\n",
      "\n",
      "The lesson is now imported in your ipython session in its own namespace 'lesson'. \n",
      "This object now gives us all the tools to follow this lesson. \n",
      "For instance the command:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        lesson.help()\n",
      "\n",
      "displays this lessons information text, and can be recalled at any moment. \n",
      "The main object we use to pack (connected series of) calculations is a flow. \n",
      "This lesson provides a method that returns a flow designed to perform k-point convergence studies. \n",
      "This flow is made by the command:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        flow = lesson.make_g0w0_scissors_flow()\n",
      "\n",
      "`flow` is now an object that contains al the information needed to generate abinit inputs. \n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        flow.show_inputs()\n",
      "\n",
      "will display all the inputs as they will be 'given' to abinit.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start the execution of calculations packed in this flow we use the following command:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        flow.make_scheduler().start()\n",
      "\n",
      "This starts the actual execution via a scheduler. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last step of analyzing the results can be done again in with a single command:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        flow.analyze()\n",
      "\n",
      "This method of flow will open the necessary output files, retrieve the data, and produce a plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, once you are through with this lesson and exited ipython:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        exit\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see that in the directory that you were working there is\n",
      "now a subdir were the calculation have been performed. \n",
      "Have a look at these folders and the files that are in them.\n",

      "---------\n",
      "\n",
      "As an exercise you can now start this lesson again but instead of performing the convergence study for silicon study the\n",

      "\n",
      "    .. code-block:: python\n",
      "\n",
      "        flow = lesson.make_ngkpt_flow(structure_file=lesson.abidata.cif_file('al.cif'), metal=True)\n",
      "\n",
      "you will generate a flow for aluminum. \n",
      "Actually, you can pass the path to any cif file to perform a convergence study on that material. \n",
      "Be careful however, aluminum is a metal and the default parameters for `occopt` and `tsmear` are for semiconductors. \n",
      "The keyword argument 'metal' fixes this. (you could also see what happens if you don't put this flag :-) ) \n",
      "Look at the inputs to see what has been changed and study the description of these inputvariables using the `abinit_help()` method.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have time left it is also a good exercise to open the python file that contains this lesson and study the implementations\n",
