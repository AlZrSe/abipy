      "Before starting it's worth clarifying some of the basic concepts used in `AbiPy` to automate ab-initio calculations. \n",
      "In particular, in this paragraph we will focus on the following three objects: \n",
      "\n",
      "   * `Task`\n",
      "   * `Work`\n",
      "   * `Flow`\n",
      "   \n",
      "The `Task` represent the most elementary step of the calculation. \n",
      "Roughly speaking, it corresponds to the execution of an ABINIT run.\n",
      "From the point of view of `Abipy`, a calculation consists of a set of `Tasks` that are connected together by some sort of dependency. \n",
      "Each task has a list of files that are needed to start the calculation, and a list of files that are produced at the end of the run.\n",
      "Some of the input files needed by a `Task` must be provided by the user in the form of ABINIT input variables \n",
      "(e.g. the crystalline structure), other inputs (files) may be produced by othe tasks.\n",
      "When a `Task` B requires the output file `DEN` of another calculation A, we say that B depends on A through F and \n",
      "we express this dependency using the python dictionary  \n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "B_deps = {A: \"DEN\"}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Work` can be seen as a (dynamic) list of `Tasks` and `AbiPy` provides several pre-built \n",
      "factory functions for typical first-principles calculations.\n",
      "Finally, the `Flow` is a list of `Work` objects whose main goal is providing an easy-to-use\n",
      "interface for performing common operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify this point, let's take a standard $KS$ band structure calculation as example.\n",
      "In this case, we have an initial `ScfTask` that solves the KS equations self-consistently to produce a density file. \n",
      "The density is then used by a second `NscfTask` to produce a band structure on an arbitrary \n",
      "set of $k$-points.\n",
      "The `NscfTask` has thus a dependency on the first `ScfTask` in the sense that it cannot be executed until \n",
      "the `ScfTask` is completed and the `DEN` file produced by the `ScfTask` is needed as input.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the `Works` and the `Tasks` of a flow are created and executed inside the `Flow` working directory (`workdir`) \n",
      "that is usually specified by the user during the creation of the `Flow`.\n",
      "`Abipy` will then create the workdir of the different Works/Tasks when the `Flow` is executed\n",
      "for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each `Task` has an associated set of input variables that will be used to generate the ABINIT input file and run the calculation. \n",
      "This input **must** be provided by the user during the creation of the `Task`.\n",
      "Fortunately `AbiPy` provides an object named `AbiInput` that facilitates the creation of such input. \n",
      "Once you have an `AbiInput` object, you can create the corresponding `Task`.\n",
      "In pseudo code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "new_task = Task(abi_input)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Task` provides several method for monitoring the status of the ABINIT run and perform some \n",
      "analysis or post-processing of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately you do not need to understand all the technical details of the python implementation.\n",
      "In many cases, indeed, we already provide some kind of `Work` or `Flow` that automates \n",
      "your calculation and you only have to provide the correct list of input files \n",
      "that obviously must be consistent with the Flow/Work that is being created.\n",
      "(you should pass a list of inputs for performing a band structure calculation to a flow \n",
      "that is expected to compute phonons with DFPT!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next paragrap, we discuss how to construct a `Flow` for band-structure calculations\n",
      "with a high-level interface that only requires the specifications on the input files.\n",
      "This example allows us to discuss the most important methods of the `Flow` you will be using \n",
      "to perform calculations."
