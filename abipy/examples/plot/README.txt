AbiPy Gallery
=============

There are a variety of ways to use the AbiPy post-processing tools, 
and most of them are illustrated in the examples in this directory.
Execute the ``_runplots.py`` script for an overview of the AbiPy capabilities.

Remember that one can also generate a jupyter notebook directly from the command line with the command:

    abiopen.py FILE -nb
