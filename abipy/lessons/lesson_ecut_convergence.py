Basis set convergence study and some more on flows, works, and tasks. 
=====================================================================

Background
----------

This lesson focuses on the convergence study on the completeness
of the basis set. In our case the basis set consists of plane
waves. Plane waves are inherently well suited to capture the periodic
nature of a crystalline solid. In addition a plane wave basis set
has the advantage that it introduces only one convergence parameter,
the kinetic energy cutoff (ecut).

The sharp features of the wavefunctions near the nucleus are however
problematic for plane waves. Describing these features would require
very high energy plane waves. In practice we will always use
pseudo-potentials instead of the actual nuclear potential to facilitate
convergence. Effectively a pseudopotential replaces the sharp coulomb
potential of the nucleus and the core electrons by something smoother
inside the pseudization region that connects smoothly to the real potential
outside the pseudization region.

Needless to say a different pseudo potential will require a different
cutoff for the calculation to be converged. In general norm-conserving
pseudos require a larger cut-off that ultra-soft pseudos or Projector
Augmented Wave 'pseudos'. 
Moreover two pseudos of the same type for the same element may require different
cutoffs as well. 'Harder' (having a smaller pseudization radius) require
larger cutoffs than 'softer' pseudos. There are however many more
properties of a pseudo that determine the cutoff needed.

The related abinit variables
----------------------------

As said, the most important parameter is the energy cutoff (ecut input variable).
The most important input parameters concerning the basis set are:

    * ecut 
    * pawecutdg (additional variable for PAW)
    * ecutsm

from __future__ import division, print_function

_ipython_lesson_ = """
More info on the inputvariables and their use can be obtained using the
following function:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.docvar("inputvariable")

The abipy flows in this lesson
------------------------------

This lesson contains a factory function for a ecut convergence study. In this lesson we will discuss a few more
properties and methods of flows.

The course of this lesson
-------------------------

Start this lesson by importing it in a new namespace

    .. code-block:: python

        from abipy.lessons.lesson_ecut_convergence import Lesson
        lesson = Lesson()

As always you can reread this lesson's text using the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson

To build the flow:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_ecut_flow()

To print the input files

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_inputs()

In this lesson we take a closer look at the structure of a Flow. In general
a flow is a container that contains 'works'. Works are (connected) series
of abinit executions we call tasks. To show the works contained in a flow
use the 'works' method:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.works

to show the status of a flow:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_status()

There are many more properties and methods of a flow than may also come in
handy. By typing [tab] in ipython after the period, you will be presented
with all the option. Feel free to experiment a bit at this point. By adding
a questionmark to the method or property ipython will show the information
and description of it:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.build()
        flow.open_files?

The build() method will create the input files, open_files() can be used to open them.

Will explain what this method is supposed to do.

Start the flow with the scheduler and wait for completion.

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.make_scheduler().start()

To analyze the results.

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.analyze(flow)

Exercises
---------

As for the kpoint convergence study, try to run the convergence study for Al.

Get a copy of the python script we use in this lesson like before. In the lesson class definition you'll find the
analyze method. Execute the parts to get the dataframe. Use the commands you learned in this lesson to find out what
else is contained in the dataframe. Make some more convergence plots.

If you like to dig in more look up the pandas package on internet. The dataframe the robot returns is a pandas dataframe
all the thing that have been programmed in that package are at your disposal.


Next
----

A logical next lesson would be lesson_relaxation

"""

_commandline_lesson_ = """
The full description,
directly from the abinit description is available via the following function:

    .. code-block:: shell

        abidoc.py man inputvariable

This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.

The cource of this lesson
-------------------------

As in the previous lesson, executing the python script created the folder structure with the in input files for this
lesson.

One of the standard thing to look for to be converged in the total energy. We did that already in the previous lesson.
This time have a look at some of the other important properties. Look for instance at the convergence rate of the
forces, stress-tensor or the energies of the KS-orbitals.

Exercises
---------

Edit the input files to run the same convergence study for a different k-point mesh. Best to start small.
