.TH Relaxation "" "" "of the unit cell with two different techniques"
.SH Background
.PP
One of the tasks that is most performed using DFT is the relaxation of
an atomic structure.
Effectively we search for that structure for which the total energy is
minimal.
Since the total energy is in principal exact in DFT the atomic position
are in general rather good.
\[aq]In principal\[aq] means if the exchange\-correlation functional
would be exact.
However, since we are comparing differences in total energies an certain
amount of error\-cancellation can be expected.
.PP
In this lesson we focus on different types of structure relaxations.

description is available via the following function:

This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.

As in the previous lessons, executing the python script created the
folder structure with the input files for this lesson.
.PP
For the flow_si_relax folder, look in particular to the changes in the
unit cell (rprim) in the input files and the corresponding change in
unit cell volume (ucvol), total energy (etotal) and stresses (strten) in
the output file.
For the flow_gan_relax, observe in the input and output files how the
automatic relaxation takes place.
At each step of the relaxation a full SCF\-cycle is done, to compute the
forces and the stress, the ions are moved and then a new SCF\-cycle is
done until convergence is done.
That\[aq]s why there are two stopping criterion for this task : tolrff
or tolvrs for the SCF cycle and tolmxf for the relaxation in itself.
.SH Exercises
.PP
Edit the input files to run the same jobs with different ecut values for
example.
.PP
You can also try to change the stopping criterion to see what are the
effects of them.
.PP
Finally, try to generate the input file for silicon, and try to guess
why setting stopping criterion on forces won\[aq]t work in that case !
