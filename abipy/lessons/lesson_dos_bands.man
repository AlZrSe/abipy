.TH "The calculation of the density of states and the bandstructure." "" "" "" ""
.SH Background
.PP
This lesson focuses on the calculation of the density of states (DOS)
and the electronic band structure withing the Kohn\-Sham (KS) formalism.
.PP
In contrast to the total energy and its derivatives, the energies of the
KS\-levels have no exact physical meaning, except for the highest
occupied state that actually would be the first ionization energy if the
functional would be exact.
So why would we even want to calculate the KS\-DOS and band structure?
In most cases the KS spectrum is qualitatively in agreement with the
spectrum of ionization energies.
Moreover in general we are able to make good predictions on trends.
.PP
In lesson_g0w0.py, we discuss a more elaborated and accurate approach
for the calculation of band energies and band gaps.

At this place they will not be discussed in detail.
In stead you are invited to read the abinit documentation on them.
