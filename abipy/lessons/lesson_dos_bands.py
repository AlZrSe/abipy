The calculation of the density of states and the bandstructure.
===============================================================

Background
----------

This lesson focuses on calculating the density of states (DOS) and the band structure. On thing one should always
keep in mind is that these are the densities of states and the bandstructure of the KS-particles. If you feel patronised
by this remark please continue to the next section, else keep reading :-).

In contrast to the total energy and derivatives of it, the energies of the KS-levels have no exact physical meaning,
except for the highest occupied state that actually would be the first ionization energy if the functional would be
exact. So why would we even want to calculate the KS-DOS and band structure? In most cases the KS spectrum is
qualitatively in agreement with the spectum of ionization energies. Moreover in general we are able to make good
predictions on trends.


The related abinit variables
----------------------------

    * kptopt (negative values)
    * ndivsm
    * prtdos (if you want Abinit to compute the dos)
    * kptbounds (if you want to specify the bounds of the k-path)

More info on the inputvariables and their use can be obtained using the following function:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.docvar("inputvariable")

This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.

The abipy flows in this lesson
------------------------------

The flow that we use in this lesson contains for the first time dependencies.
This means that some tasks in the flow can only be started if an other task is
ready. We will first perform one self-consistent calculation to obtain a proper
density. Using this density we calculate in two more steps the DOS and the bandstructure.
For the DOS this not stricktly nessesary since the DOS will also be calculated on a regular grid.
In general the density will be converged already before the DOS is converged. For large systems it may become
nessesary to split. For the bandstructure we have a non-uniform grid so we do need to fix the density.

The course of this lesson
-------------------------

Start this lessen by importing it in a new namespace:

    .. code-block:: python

        from abipy.lesson.lesson_dos_bands import Lesson()
        lesson = Lesson()

As always you can reread this lessons text using the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson

To build the flow:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_flow()

To print the input files

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_inputs()

To visualize the dependencies in the flow:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_dependencies()

Start the flow with the scheduler and wait for completion.

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.make_scheduler().start()

To analyze the results.

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.analyze(flow)

At this place they will not be discussed in detail. In stead you are
invited to read the abinit documentation on them. The full description,
directly from the abinit description is available via the following function:

    .. code-block:: shell

        abidocs.py man inputvariable

This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.
