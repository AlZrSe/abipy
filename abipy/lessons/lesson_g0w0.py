\033[91m Computation of the G0W0 band structure of silicon with a energy-dependent scissors operator.\033[0m

\033[94m Background\033[0m

Kohn-Sham (KS) eigenvalues are Lagrangian multipliers 
Standard approximations for XC functionals (e.g. LDA, GGA) severely underestimate band-gaps

\033[94m The related abinit variables\033[0m

\033[1m optdriver \033[0m
\033[1m ecuteps \033[0m
\033[1m ecutsigx \033[0m

More info on the input variables and their use can be obtained using the following function:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m lesson.abinit_help(inputvariable)

This will print the official abinit description of this variables.

\033[94m The abipy flows of this lesson\033[0m

In this lesson, we will construct an abipy flow made of two works.
The first work is a standard KS band-structure calculation that consists of 
an initial GS calculation to get the density followed by two NSCF calculations.
The first NSCF task computes the KS eigenvalues on a high-symmetry path in the BZ,
whereas the second NSCF task is done on a homogeneous k-mesh so that one can calculate 
the DOS from the KS eigenvalues. These two NSCF tasks 

The second work represents a typical GW workflow in which we read the density computed 
in the first task of the previous work to obtain and compute the KS eigenvalues and eigenvectors
for many empty states. The WFK file produced in this step is then used to compute the 
screened interaction W. Finally we do a self-energy calculation in which we use the W produced
in the previous step and the WFK file to compute the matrix elements of the self-energy and 
the G0W0 corrections for all the k-points in the IBZ and 8 bands (4 occupied + 4 empty)

Once the flow is completed, we can post-process the results and compute the G0W0 band-structure
of silicon with a scissors operator...

\033[94m The Course of this lesson\033[0m

This lesson can be started in ipython by importing it:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m from abipy.lessons import lesson_g0w0 as lesson

The lesson is now imported in your ipython session in its own namespace 'lesson'. 
This object now gives us all the tools to follow this lesson. 
For instance the command:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m lesson.help()

displays this lessons information text, and can be recalled at
any moment. The main object we use to pack (connected series of)
calculations is a flow. This lesson provides a method that returns
a flow designed to perform k-point convergence studies. This flow
is made by the command:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow = lesson.make_g0w0_scissors_flow()

'flow' is now an object that contains al the information needed to generate abinit inputs. 

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.show_inputs()

will display all the inputs as they will be 'given' to abinit.

To start the execution of calculations packed in this flow we use the following command:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.make_scheduler().start()

This starts the actual execution via a scheduler. 

The last step of analyzing the results can be done again in with a single command:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.analyze()

This method of flow will open the necessary output files, retrieve
the data, and produce a plot.

Finally, once you are through with this lesson and exited ipython:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m exit

You can see that in the directory that you were working there is
now a subdir were the calculation have been performed. Have a look
at these folders and the files that are in them.

\033[93m Exercises \033[0m

As an exercise you can now start this lesson again but in stead
of performing the convergence study for silicon study the
convergence for a metal. By using:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow = lesson.make_ngkpt_flow(structure_file=lesson.abidata.cif_file('al.cif'), metal=True)

you will generate a flow for aluminum. Actually, you can pass
the path to any cif file to perform a convergence study on that
material. Be careful however, aluminum is a metal and the default
parameters for occopt and tsmear are for semiconductors. The
keyword argument 'metal' fixes this. (you could also see what
happens if you don't put this flag :-) ) Look at the inputs to
see what has been changed and study the description of these
inputvariables using the abinit_help() method.

If you have time left it is also a good exercise to open the
python file that contains this lesson and study the implementations
of the classes, methods and functions we used. 
You can get a copy of the file by using:
