Relaxation of the unit cell with two different techniques
=========================================================

Background
----------

One of the tasks that is most performed using DFT is the relaxation of an
atomic structure. Effectively we search for that structure for which the
total energy is minimal. Since the total energy is in principal exact in
DFT the atomic position are in general rather good. 'In principal' means
if the exchange-correlation functional would be exact. However, since we
are comparing differences in total energies an certain amount of
error-cancellation can be expected.

In this lesson we focus on different types of structure relaxations.

The related abinit variables
----------------------------

    * ionmov
    * optcell
    * dilatmx
    * ecutsm
    * ntime
    * tolmxf
    * tolrff

More info on the inputvariables and their use can be obtained using
the following function:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.docvar("inputvariable")


The abipy flows in this lesson
------------------------------

In this lesson we will use two different relaxation flows. One flow will
calculate the total energies of a compound at various volumes and fit an
equation of state to the energy v.s. volume data. Besides the optimal
volume, where the energy is minimal, this will also provide the bulk modulus,
the 'compressebility' of the systems. The other flow will automatically
optimize all degrees of freedom. In our first example Si, there is only
one degree of freedom, due to the symmetry of the crystal, the volume of
the unit cell, or the lattice parameter. In the second example, GaN, the
symmetry is lower and one additional internal degree of freedom appears,
for example the distance between gallium and arsenide.


The course of this lesson
-------------------------

Start this lesson by importing it in a new namespace:

    .. code-block:: python

        from abipy.lessons.lesson_relaxation import Lesson()
        lesson = Lesson()

As always you can reread this lessons text using the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson

To build the flow for silicon

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_relax_eos_flow()

For Gallium Arsenide, use

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_relax_relax_flow()

To print the input files

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_inputs()

Start the flow with the scheduler and wait for completion.

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.make_scheduler().start()

To analyze the results.

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.analyze(flow)

In the case of silicon, it will show a fit of the total energy vs the
volume of the unit cell. The minimum of this curve is the equilibrium
volume. From this fit, we can also obtain the bulk modulus.
This approach is only applicable for isotropic materials since we are
scaling the entire volume.

Try to compare the results with these experimental results:
Volume of the unit cell of silicon : 40.05 A^3 [NSM]
Bulk modulus : 98 GPa [NSM]

For gallium arsenide
In the case of gallium arsenide, you will see the change of equilibrium
volume and length of the box with respect to the k-point mesh.

Try to compare the results with these experimental results:
Volume of the unit cell of GaN : 45.73 A^3 [Schulz & Thiemann 1977]
Lattice parameters of GaN : a = 3.190 A, c = 5.189 A [Schulz & Thiemann 1977]
Vertical distance between Ga and N : about 0.377 * c [ Schulz & Thiemann, 1977]

Of course you will need to converge your results with respect to
the kpoint sampling and with respect with ecut...

The pseudopotentials we are using are of GGA type, which tends to
overestimate the lattice parameters. If you use LDA-type pseudopotentials,
you will observe that they would tend to underestimate the parameters.

Exercises
---------

As an exercise you can now try to get the equilibrium unit cell
of silicon automatically using abinit. You can inspire yourself
from the GaN relaxation. First download a local copy of the python
script.

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.get_local_copy()

And have a look in make_relax_gan_flow(), try to do the same
with 'si.cif' file instead of 'gan.cif'

Pay attention to the fact that for silicon, you cannot use tolrff
to stop your self-consistent cycle. Actually, as silicon has no
internal degree of freedom the forces are zero in the unit cell and
this criterion makes no sense.

As a second exercise, you can try to converge the results obtained
here with respect to the k-point sampling and with respect to ecut
and compare the converged results with experimental data.

Next
----

A logical next lesson would be lesson_dos_bands
"""

_commandline_lesson_ = """
At this place they will not be discussed in detail. Instead you are
invited to read the abinit documentation on them. The full description,
directly from the abinit description is available via the following function:

    .. code-block:: shell

        abidocs.py man inputvariable

This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.
