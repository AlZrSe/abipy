Relaxation of the unit cell with two different techniques
=========================================================

Background
----------

One of the tasks that is most performed using DFT is the relaxation of an
atomic structure. Effectively we search for that structure for which the
total energy is minimal. Since the total energy is in principle exact in
DFT the atomic position are in general rather good. 'In principle' means
if the exchange-correlation functional would be exact. However, since we
are comparing differences in total energies an certain amount of
error-cancellation can be expected.

In this lesson we focus on different types of structure relaxations.

The related abinit variables

    * optcell
    * dilatmx
    * ecutsm
    * ntime
    * tolmxf
    * tolrff

More info on the input variables and their use can be obtained using:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.docvar("inputvariable")


Description of the lesson
-------------------------

In this lesson, we will use two different relaxation flows. One flow will
calculate the total energies of a compound at various volumes and fit an
equation of state to the energy v.s. volume data. Besides the optimal
volume, where the energy is minimal, this will also provide the bulk modulus,
the 'compressibility' of the systems. The other flow will automatically
optimize all degrees of freedom. In our first example Si, there is only
one degree of freedom, due to the symmetry of the crystal, the volume of
the unit cell, or the lattice parameter. In the second example, GaN, the
symmetry is lower and one additional internal degree of freedom appears,
for example the distance between Ga and N.

Executing the lesson
--------------------

Start this lesson by importing it with the commands:

    .. code-block:: python

        from abipy.lessons.lesson_relaxation import Lesson
        lesson = Lesson()

As usual, you can reread this text using the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson

To build the flow for silicon

    .. code-block:: python

        si_flow = lesson.make_eos_flow()

For Gallium Nitride, use

    .. code-block:: python

        gan_flow = lesson.make_relax_flow()

To print the input files

    .. code-block:: python

        si_flow.show_inputs()

Start the flow with the scheduler and wait for completion.

    .. code-block:: python

        si_flow.make_scheduler().start()

To analyze the results.

    .. code-block:: python

        # For Silicon
        lesson.analyze_eos_flow(si_flow)

        # For Gallium Nitride, use
        lesson.analyze_eos_flow(gan_flow)

In the case of silicon, python will show a fit of the total energy vs the
volume of the unit cell. The minimum of this curve is the equilibrium
volume. From this fit, we can also obtain the bulk modulus.
Note that this approach is only applicable to isotropic materials since the
equation of state has been obtained by performing 
a homegeneous compressions/dilatation of the initial Bravais lattice.

Try to compare the results with these experimental results:
Volume of the unit cell of silicon: 40.05 A^3 [NSM]
Bulk modulus: 98 GPa [NSM]

For gallium nitride
In the case of gallium nitride, you will see the change of equilibrium
volume and length of the box with respect to the k-point mesh.

Try to compare the results with these experimental results:

    * Volume of the unit cell of GaN: 45.73 A^3 [Schulz & Thiemann 1977]
    * Lattice parameters of GaN: a = 3.190 A, c = 5.189 A [Schulz & Thiemann 1977]
    * Vertical distance between Ga and N : about 0.377 * c [ Schulz & Thiemann, 1977]

Of course you will need to converge your results with respect to the k-point sampling and the 
cutoff energy ecut.

In this example we are using pseudopotentials generated with the GGA which tends to 
overestimate the lattice parameters. 
If you use LDA-type pseudopotentials, you will observe that LDA tends to underestimate the parameters.

Exercises
---------

As an exercise you can now try to get the equilibrium unit cell of silicon automatically using abinit. 
You can use the code for the relaxation of GaN as template.
First download a local copy of the python script.

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.get_local_copy()

and have a look at the code in make_relax_gan_flow().
Try to do the same with 'si.cif' file instead of 'gan.cif'

Pay attention to the fact that for silicon, you cannot use tolrff
to stop your self-consistent cycle. 
Silicon has no internal degree of freedom, the forces are zero by symmetry. 
and hence the tolrff criterion makes no sense.

As a second exercise, you can try to converge the results for silicon with respect 
to the k-point sampling and ecut.
Compare the converged results with experimental data.

Next

A logical next lesson would be lesson_dos_bands
"""


_commandline_lesson_ = """
The full description of the variables, directly from the abinit documentation is available via the shell command:

    .. code-block:: shell

        abidoc.py man inputvariable

that prints the official description of `inputvariable`.

As in the previous lessons, executing the python script creates the folder structure with the input files for this
lesson.

For the flow_si_relax folder, look in particular to the changes in the unit cell (rprim) in the input files and the
corresponding change in the unit cell volume (ucvol), total energy (etotal) and stresses (strten) in the output file.
For the flow_gan_relax, observe in the output files how the automatic relaxation takes place.
At each step of the relaxation, a full SCF-cycle is performed and forces and the stress are computed. 
The ions are then moved according to the forces and a new SCF-cycle is started.
The procedure is interated until convergence is achieved. 
This is the reason why there are two stopping criteria for structural relaxation:
tolrff or tolvrs are used for the SCF cycle whereas tolmxf govers the relaxation algorithm.

Exercises
---------

Edit the input files to run the same jobs with different values of ecut. 

You can also try to change the stopping criterion to see if this affects the final results.

Finally, try to generate the input file for silicon, and try to guess why setting the stopping 
criterion on the forces won't work in this case!
