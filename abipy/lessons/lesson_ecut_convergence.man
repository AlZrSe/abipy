.TH "Basis set convergence study and some more on flows, works, and tasks." "" "" "" ""
.SH Background
.PP
This lesson focuses on the convergence study on the completeness of the
basis set.
In our case the basis set consists of plane waves.
Plane waves are inherently well suited to capture the periodic nature of
a crystalline solid.
In addition a plane wave basis set has the advantage that it introduces
only one convergence parameter, the kinetic energy cutoff (ecut).
.PP
The sharp features of the wavefunctions near the nucleus are however
problematic for plane waves.
Describing these features would require very high energy plane waves.
In practice we will always use pseudo\-potentials instead of the actual
nuclear potential to facilitate convergence.
Effectively a pseudopotential replaces the sharp coulomb potential of
the nucleus and the core electrons by something smoother inside the
pseudization region that connects smoothly to the real potential outside
the pseudization region.
.PP
Needless to say a different pseudo potential will require a different
cutoff for the calculation to be converged.
In general norm\-conserving pseudos require a larger cut\-off that
ultra\-soft pseudos or Projector Augmented Wave \[aq]pseudos\[aq].
Moreover two pseudos of the same type for the same element may require
different cutoffs as well.
\[aq]Harder\[aq] (having a smaller pseudization radius) require larger
cutoffs than \[aq]softer\[aq] pseudos.
There are however many more properties of a pseudo that determine the
cutoff needed.
.SH The related abinit variables
.PP
As said, the most important parameter is the energy cutoff (ecut input
variable).
The most important input parameters concerning the basis set are:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
ecut
.IP \[bu] 2
pawecutdg (additional variable for PAW)
.IP \[bu] 2
ecutsm
.RE
.PP
The full description, directly from the abinit description is available
via the following function:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
abidocs.py\ man\ inputvariable
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.

As in the previous lesson, executing the python script created the
folder structure with the in input files for this lesson.
.PP
One of the standard thing to look for to be converged in the total
energy.
We did that already in the previous lesson.
This time have a look at some of the other important properties.
Look for instance at the convergence rate of the forces, stress\-tensor
or the energies of the KS\-orbitals.
.SH Exercises
.PP
Edit the input files to run the same convergence study for a different
k\-point mesh.
Best to start small.
