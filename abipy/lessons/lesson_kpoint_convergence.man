.TH K\-point "" "" "convergence study for a semi\-conductor and an introduction
  some of the basic concepts of the abipy library."
.SH Background
.PP
This lesson deals with the basic k\-point convergence study that is
needed in any DFT calculation of a solid.
In a DFT calculation of a solid the first Brillouin zone needs to be
discretized to enable the integration of various quantities.
Effectively the integrals are turned in to sums over k\-points.
For any result to be converged we need a k\-point mesh that is dense
enough, but at the same time as coarse as possible to make for an
efficient calculation.
Various types of materials require in general different densities of the
k\-point meshes.
In general metals need denser meshes than semiconductors, because of the
need to accurately sample the fermi surface.
Your first investigation into a new compound will quit often be a
k\-point convergence study.
.SH The related abinit variables
.PP
The abinit parameters concerned with the k\-point grid are:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
ngkpt
.IP \[bu] 2
shiftk
.IP \[bu] 2
occopt (see exercises)
.IP \[bu] 2
tsmear (see exercises)
.IP \[bu] 2
kptopt (see exercises)
.RE
.PP
At this place they will not be discussed in detail.
In stead you are invited to read the abinit documentation on them.
The full description, directly from the official abinit description is
available via the following function:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
lesson.docvar("inputvariable")
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.
.SH The abipy flows of this lesson
.PP
When performed manually, a k\-point convergence study would require the
preparation of a series of input\-files, running abinit for all the
inputs and extracting and studying the quantity that is needed to be
converged.
This lesson shows how this process can be greatly facilitated by using
python scripts in the abipy framework.
We will construct a single python object, a abipy flow, that contains
all the information needed for the calculations but also provides
methods for actually running abinit, inspecting the input and output,
and analyzing the results.
.PP
All calculations will however still be run in parallel.
.SH The Course of this lesson
.PP
This lesson can be started in ipython by importing it:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
from\ abipy.lessons.lesson_kpoint_convergence\ import\ Lesson
lesson\ =\ Lesson()
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
The lesson is now imported in your ipython session in its own namespace
\[aq]lesson\[aq].
This object now gives us all the tools to follow this lesson.
For instance the command:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
lesson
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
displays this lessons information text, and can be recalled at any
moment.
The main object we use to pack (connected series of) calculations is a
flow.
This lesson provides a method that returns a flow designed to perform
k\-point convergence studies.
This flow is made by the command:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
flow\ =\ lesson.make_ngkpt_flow()
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
\[aq]flow\[aq] is now an object that contains al the information needed
to generate abinit input.
In this case it is a special flow for a k\-point convergence study and
since we did not specify anything when generating the flow the example
case of silicon is generated.
Our flow however, inherited from the abinit base flow so we have a lot
of \[aq]standard\[aq] methods available.
For instance:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
flow.show_inputs()
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
This will display all the inputs as they will be \[aq]given\[aq] to
abinit.
.PP
To start the execution of calculations packed in this flow we and use
the following command:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
flow.make_scheduler().start()
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
This starts the actual execution via a scheduler.
The scheduler is a sort of daemon that starts to submit tasks that are
ready to run.
In our case all the tasks in the flow are independent so the first cycle
of the scheduler directly submitted all of them.
More complicated flows may have tasks that can only start using input
from a previous task.
We will encounter some of those later.
.PP
The last step of analyzing the results can be done again in with a
single command:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
lesson.analyze(flow)
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
This method of flow will open the necessary output files, retrieve the
data, and produce a plot.
.PP
Finally, once you are through with this lesson and exited ipython:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
exit
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
You can see that in the directory that you were working there is now a
subdir were the calculation have been performed.
Have a look at these folders and the files that are in them.
.SH Exercises
.PP
As an exercise you can now start this lesson again but in stead of
performing the convergence study for silicon study the convergence for a
metal.
By using:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
flow\ =\ lesson.make_ngkpt_flow(structure_file=lesson.abidata.cif_file(\[aq]al.cif\[aq]),\ metal=True)
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
you will generate a flow for aluminum.
Actually, you can pass the path to any cif file to perform a convergence
study on that material.
Be careful however, aluminum is a metal and the default parameters for
occopt and tsmear are for semiconductors.
The keyword argument \[aq]metal\[aq] fixes this.
(you could also see what happens if you don\[aq]t put this flag :\-) )
Look at the inputs to see what has been changed and study the
description of these inputvariables using the abinit_help() method.
.PP
If you have time left it is also a good exercise to open the python file
that contains this lesson and study the implementations of the classes,
methods and functions we used.
You can get a copy of the file by using:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
lesson.get_local_copy()
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.PP
Try to find what to change to change the set of k\-point meshes that are
used in the convergence study.
